# 🎗️ Breast Cancer Detection using SVM

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on **breast cancer detection** using a  
**Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classification algorithm.

The objective is to predict whether a tumor is **malignant** or **benign**
based on diagnostic medical features.  
This project demonstrates a complete **classification machine learning workflow**.
